There are two batch files in this folder.

The first, arraySimulate.sbatch, calls the parallel binomial simulation.
It should, as a side effect, save the parameters that are part of it.

This will do M = 100 replications, currently, and save the key outputs into tempdir.
We do not keep the entire simulation output; merely the key averages.

The summary statistics can then be very quickly processed, live with CollectSims.R, or calling the file
Collect.sbatch

This will output a .RData file.
That .RData file must then be exported to home computer, in order to see graphs etc.
